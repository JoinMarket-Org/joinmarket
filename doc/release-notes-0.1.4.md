JoinMarket 0.1.4:
=================

  <https://github.com/joinmarket-org/joinmarket/releases/tag/v0.1.4>

This is a normal release, bringing bug fixes and new features.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/joinmarket-org/joinmarket/issues>

Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

There is no binary component of the installation yet supported. If you have already
installed libsodium and Python, you will not need to re-install anything, but
only update the joinmarket source code.

You can update your joinmarket.cfg file by moving or deleting it and it will be
recreated on first run.

Notable changes
===============

### secp256k1

The secp256k1 library can now be used in JoinMarket. It provides the very well
tested and robust code used in Bitcoin for the underlying signing and ECC operations.
It is recommended that everyone who is able to use secp256k1 with JoinMarket. In
case it cannot be installed, joinmarket should continue to run exactly as before.

On Linux it can be installed with

	pip install secp256k1

For past discussion on this feature which may be helpful, see this reddit thread

### Improved Stability of Tumbler Script

Many small bugfixes and features have been added with the aim of making the tumbler
script more stable and more likely to complete the entire tumbler job without crashing

### Broadcasting Transactions via Makers

In order to help stop spies that sybil attack the bitcoin p2p network in an effort
to learn the origin IP address of a transaction, JoinMarket now has a feature to
ask a maker to broadcast the coinjoin transaction with their IP.

To enable, modify the `tx_broadcast` parameter in `joinmarket.cfg`. Later versions
will have this enabled by default

### Debug Log Scrubber

JoinMarket debug logs are very useful to developers, but because they contain private
information users are often unwilling to share them publicly.

For this reason there is now a debug log scrubber script which replaces sensitive
information with placeholders that allow debugging but do not ruin privacy.

The script is found in the logs/ directory.

### Wallet History

The history of the internal wallet can now be displayed. For yield-generator users it can
work out the effective annual interest rate, as though yield-generator was a savings account.

To use, configure JoinMarket to use a Bitcoin node as a method of accessing the blockchain
and run:

	python wallet-tool.py wallet.json history

A csv file can be created for opening with spreadsheet software too:

	python wallet-tool.py --csv wallet.json history > history.csv
